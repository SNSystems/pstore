## A test which runs pstore broker and its "broker poker" utility to fire
## messages at it. We check that the broker responds correctly to those
## commands.

# %binaries = the directories containing the executable binaries
# %T = the test output directory
# %S = the test source directory

REQUIRES: broker
RUN: python "%S/broker1.py" "%binaries" > "%T/broker1_actual.txt"
RUN: diff "%T/broker1_actual.txt" "%S/broker1_expected.txt"

#eof broker1.test
