## Installed tools

### Exchange

Tools for textual export and import of the contents of a pstore file.

| Name | Description |

| [pstore&#8209;import](import/) | Creates a pstore repository from an export file created by pstore&#8209;export. |

### Exploring

The utility programs in this group enable you to inspect and explore the contents of a pstore database.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [pstore&#8209;diff](diff/) | Dumps diff between two pstore revisions. |
| [pstore&#8209;dump](dump/) | Dumps pstore contents as YAML. |
| [pstore&#8209;index&#8209;stats](index_stats/) | Dumps statistics about the index trees in a pstore file as CSV. |

### Garbage Collection

| Name | Description |

| [pstore&#8209;vacuumd](vacuum/) | Data store garbage collector. |


### Read and Write

These utilities are included purely to provide a simple means of experimenting with the pstore library. `pstore-write` enables you to store specific key/value pairs or whole files in a database (where the key is the file path and the value is the fileâ€™s contents). `pstore-read`, on the other hand, allows the data that is recorded by `pstore-write` to be extracted by printing it to stdout.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [pstore&#8209;read](read/) | A utility for reading the write or strings index. |
| [pstore&#8209;write](write/) | A utility for writing to the write or strings index. |
